## Research overview

Understanding how monetary policymakers' use **communication** (speeches +
press releases) to:

- **respond** to their political principals

- **develop credibility**

## Developed vs. Developing

Monetary policymakers:

**Developed**: tend to have **established**
credibility and autonomy and may be using communication to **protect** it.

**Developing**: **trying to establish**
these qualities.

## Monetary policymaking in developed economies (US)

- What do monetary policymakers consider stressful?

    + Mandated areas?

    + Something else (e.g. housing)?

- What **non-policy tools** do they use to respond to this stress?

    + Reaching out to important interest groups?

    + What they talk about?

## Monetary policymaking in developing economies (India)

- How is monetary policy **communication credibility** enhanced?

- What impact do central bank governor **appointments** have on communication
credibility?

## Some issues we are trying to tackle (1)

Data (i.e. text) **availability**. Limited series of easily machine
readable texts.

- Tools for accessing the data seem almost as important as tools for
analysing it.

## Some issues we are trying to tackle (2)

**Integrating disparate types** of information, e.g. texts from multiple
sources, locational data, macroeconomic indicators.

## Some issues we are trying to tackle (3)

Identifying **state changes** in complex data.

## Some issues we are trying to tackle (4)

In both topic models and change point models we need to **a priori define**
features of the underlying quantities (e.g. number of topics, minimum length
of states).

## Some issues we are trying to tackle (5)

Using **topic proportions** as **dependent variables**:

- Beta regression and Zero-One inflated Beta regression
[e.g @ospina2010inflated] give results that many audiences
find **confusing**.

## Data availability (US Federal Reserve Project)

\> 1100 Fed governor speeches from June
1996 through present are easily accessible.

Government Printing Office has House and Senate transcripts from 2001-2012
easily accessible. Filled in with Committee websites, so:

- Relevant House: 188 transcripts from May 1997-2012

- Relevant Senate: 144 transcripts from 2001-2012

## Data availability (US Federal Reserve Project)

Effectively, our data is limited to the late 1990s through (about) the
present.

Greatly **limits the generalisability** of our findings as this is a very
particular period of US monetary policymaking.

More work needs to be done **creating corpora** of legislative and
monetary policymaking transcripts.  

Should be **easily and freely accessible** to improve **scientific
efficiency**.

## Data Availability (Resere Bank of India Project)

## Integrating disparate types of information

[FILL IN]

## Identifying state changes

Posit that there are different "scrutiny states" (e.g. low, high).

Each month or congressional hearing is not independent. But there is some
underling scrutiny state that spans months.

How to estimate?

## Defining features a priori

Non-parametric change point methods [e.g. @Matteson2014] require **minimum
state lengths** to be determined a priori.

Topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation requires a priori
specification of **number of topics**.

## Attempts to justify assumptions

Guided by **substantive prior knowledge** + what we **learn from the
data**.

**Rule of thumb for change point**: aim for the smallest substantively
meaningful minimum sizes to avoid arbitrarily ignoring shorter clusters.

**Rule of thumb for topic modelling**: smallest number of topics without
overlap.

## Defining features a priori

Nonetheless **reviewers seem to be skeptical** of methods where features of
the data need to be defined a priori.

How to overcome this skepticism?
